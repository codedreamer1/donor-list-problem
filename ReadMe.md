# Donor List Problem #
## Description ##
A charity organization uses volunteers to reach out to a large body of potential donors through
different communication channels (email, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, phone, mail, etc.)

- Each communication channel requires the volunteer dedicate a fixed amount of time (3
min for an email, 4 min for LinkedIn, 1 min for an Instagram msg, etc.)
- Each volunteer has a limited time budget he or she can dedicate to this effort
- For each donor the charity keeps a file including the full name, unique identifier (SSN,
Meta, etc.), preferred communication channel and expected donation.

The charity provides volunteers with lists of donors they can contact within their time budget
and would like the expected donations from the lists to be high.
